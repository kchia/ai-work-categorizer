## Why I Recommend Solution 3

**Solution 3 – Agentic Workflow Orchestrator**
_“Action layer of autonomous agents sitting on top of the existing stack.”_

**1. Best strategic fit**

- Extends Work Categorizer: from **observing** roles/work (Work Categorizer) to **acting** on that insight.
- Directly supports Parable’s positioning as the **operating system for the enterprise**, not just another analytics or UI layer. It’s the **core action layer** Parable can build once and reuse across the enterprise.
- Framework can be reused for other roles (engineering, support, HR), not just sales.

**2. Strongest business impact with a de-risked path**

- Total annual impact: **~$18–59M** for a 100-rep org (hard savings + revenue uplift).
- Admin time cut by **60–70%+**, enabling 3–5 additional calls per rep per day.
- **MVP path:** 3-month, ~$500k “post-call only”, before committing to the full multi-month build.
